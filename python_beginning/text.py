#0x1 Python - Beginning!
#Requirements for Python scripts
#Allowed editors are Vim, Vi, Emacs

#The first line of all your files should have Python shebang (like this #!/usr/bin/python3)

#You are not allowed to cast anything to string in the tasks

#You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.

#A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository

vA README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory

#Your code should use the pycodestyle

#You should follow best practices in writing you code - python style guides

#All your files must be executable

#All the files in this project should be in GitHub Repository: webdrivercamp-learning-python/python_beginning

#0. Print
#python docs - tutorial 

#Write a Python script that prints exactly Learning Python is fun"'



 #$ ./0_simple_print.py 
#Learning Python is fun"'
 #$ 
File: 0_simple_print.py

#1. Add some numbers
#string format

#Copy the file from task #0

#Rename it to 1_adding_some_numbers.py

#In that file before printing create a variable and assign number 100 to it

#Now modify the print to use this variable to get: Learning Python is fun"' - 100 %

#Repeat the print 3 time using 3 different string formats from newest to oldest



 # $ ./1_adding_some_numbers.py
#Learning Python is fun"' - 100 %
#Learning Python is fun"' - 100 %
#Learning Python is fun"' - 100 %
 v$ 
#File: 1_adding_some_numbers.py

#2. Print a float
#Copy the file from task #1

#Rename it to 2_modify_numbers.py

#Change the number 100 to 3.141592653589793238

#Now modify the prints to get the float number printed with only 2 digits followed



 #$ ./2_modify_numbers.py
#Learning Python is fun"' - 3.14 %
#Learning Python is fun"' - 3.14 %
#Learning Python is fun"' - 3.14 %
# $ 
#File: 2_modify_numbers.py

#3. PrintPrintPrint
#Create a variable and assign “Yes!“ to it

#Print the variable 4 times



 #$ ./3_pritnprint.py
#Yes!Yes!Yes!Yes!
# $ 
#File: 3_printprint.py

#4. Concat strings
#string concatenation

#Create a variable and assign “Webdriver” to it

#Create another variable and assign “Camp“ to it

#Create a third variable and assign two strings above concatenated

#Now print using the third variable only



 #$ ./4_two_str_print.py 
#Welcome to Webdriver Camp!
 #$ 
#File: 4_two_str_print.py
#5. Slice that, please 
#slicing strings

#Create one variable and assign Webdriver Awesome Camp to it

#Print every word of this string on a new line



 #$ ./5_sep_str_print.py 
#Webdriver
#Awesome
#Camp
# $ 
#File: 5_slice_that.py

#6. Print only what is needed
#Create a variable and assign this to it:

#"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. lthough that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.”

#Modify the variable to get preferably only one way unless

#Print the variable

#Note: You should have only one variable



 #$ ./6_new_str_print..py 
#preferably only one way unless 
# $ 
#File: 6_what_needed.py
